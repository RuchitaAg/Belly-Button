# Belly Button Biodiversity

This project creates a dashboard including various types of charts to visualize different parameters in the dataset. 

It has a drop-down menu to choose the ID of a data point. According to that ID value, it creates a bar chart, bubble chart and a gauge plot. 

The **bar plot** represents the top 10 bacteria cultures found on the data ID point. 

The **bubble plot** shows the details about all the bacteria cultures found in that sample.

The **gauge plot** shows the washing frequency.
